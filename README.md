# picolor.js
JavaScript color picker controls optimized for picking map colors

# Why not use a stock color picker?
Picking suitable colors for maps are hard, especially when it comes to selecting visually distinct colors for a range of values. picolor.js aims to ease that process by providing smart pre-set visually distinct colors and palettes.  

# TODO  
- Palette picker  
- Drag-interaction on sliders and color wheel  
- Remove JQuery dependency  
- Produce minified js lib  
- Extend example
